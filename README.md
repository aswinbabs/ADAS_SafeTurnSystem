# Safe Turn System 🚗💡 *(Under Development)*

**Safe Turn System** is an **Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS)** prototype designed to minimize road accidents caused by improper use of turn indicators. The system detects vehicle turns and checks if the indicator was used correctly, alerting the driver through dashboard notifications and a buzzer if not.

> ⚠️ **Project Status:** This project is currently under active development. Hardware and software components may change during the build and testing phases.
